/**
 *	This is a class to generate the magnetic declination,
 *	magnetic field strength and inclination for any point
 *	on the earth.  The true bearing = magnetic bearing + declination.
 * 	This class is adapted from an Applet from the NOAA National Data Center
 *	at http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/segd.shtml.  None of the calculations
 *	were changed.  This class requires an input file named WMM-95.DAT, which
 *	must be in the same directory that the application is run from.  
 *	NOTE: The original version of
 *	the applet, calculated the declination as a function of the date.
 *	This class assumes a date of 1 January 1999, using the 1995 geomagnetic
 *	data.  The WMM-95.DAT file will probably be updated by NOAA in Dec 1999.
 *	This version assumes the calculation is wanted for an altitude of sea level.
 *
 *	Using the correct date, the declination is accurate to about 0.5 degrees.
 *
 *  This is the LANL D-3 version of the GeoMagnetic calculator from
 *	the NOAA National Data Center at http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/segd.shtml.
 *	
 *	Adapted by John St. Ledger, Los Alamos National Laboratory
 *	June 25, 1999
 *
 *	Verified by comparison to the source code downloaded from the web.
 *	The declination calculated by that source is exactly the same as this class.
 *	The applet on the web calculates a declination several minutes 
 *	different than this class.  Suspect this is the difference between
 *	the DOD model used in this class and the IGRF model of the magnetic field.
 *	Does not return the grid variation near the poles.  These lines commented out, 
 *	and can easily be restored.
 *
 *	Version 2 Comments:  The world magnetic model is updated every 5 years.
 *	The data for 2000 uses the same algorithm to calculate the magnetic field
 *	field variables.  The only change is in the spherical harmonic coefficients
 *	in the input file.  The input file has been renamed to WMM.COF.  Once again,
 *	the date was fixed.  This time to January 1, 2001.  Also, a deprecated
 *	constructor for StreamTokenizer was replaced, and the error messages in the catch
 *	clause were changed.  Methods to get the field strength and inclination
 *	were added.
 *
 *
 *	@version 3.0
 *	January 19, 2000
 *	Updated for 2000 data.
 *
 *	@version 4.0
 *	March 1, 2002
 *	Changed so that if data file doesn't exist,
 *	it uses an internal version of the coefficients from
 *	the 2000 update.
 *
 *
 *	@version 5.0
 *	June 1, 2005
 *	Changed so that if data file doesn't exist,
 *	it uses an internal version of the coefficients from
 *	the 2005 update.  Previously, only calculated the declination at sea level
 *	for one date.  Now can return all of the variables as a function of date and
 *	altitude.  Original version used float variables.  All changed to type double.
 *	Does not check if the input date is within the valid block.
 *
 *	@version 5.1
 *	June 20, 2005
 *	Fixed a bug discoverd by Alvin Liem.  In my zeal to clean up compiler comments
 *	I deleted some double casts for integers that resulted in an integer division
 *	being made when double division was needed.
